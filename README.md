# Matrix_Multiplier
5 random matrices have been generated by using matlab code
For easy matrix multiplication the matrices were divided into input data and coefficient data
The input and coefficient data of the matrices were stored in arrays in TB_Pkg module.
The input_data module coeff_data modules readsand stores the input matrix 8 bit data and sends the data to multiply module.
The matrix multiplication happens in multiply module using 4 hawdawre multipliers and the output data is sent to RAM module.
The RAM further stores the data in a 160x32_memmory this data can also be read in the RAM module.
The whole process is controlled by the acknowledge signals from the main_controller,
